The sun is bright. The sky is blue. I see a big tree. A bird sits on a branch. It sings a sweet song. The air is warm. I like this day. We can go for a walk. The park is near my home. It has green grass and flowers. Children play and laugh. It is a happy place. Let's go there now. We will have fun.
