Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction. It involves the clear exchange of information between individuals or groups. Effective communication requires not only speaking but also active listening. Without proper understanding, messages can become confused, leading to potential complications. For example, in a professional environment, instructions must be precise and unambiguous. Teams that communicate efficiently often achieve better results and demonstrate higher productivity. Therefore, developing strong communication skills is considered essential for both personal relationships and career advancement.
